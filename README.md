# Torch MNIST GAN
A pytorch implementation of a GAN that generates MNIST digits.

This implementation was not based on any specific paper, but does use ideas presented in [GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) and [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).

```mnist_gan.py``` runs the experiment. It accepts a number of arguments that can be listed with ```python mnist_gan.py --help```.
